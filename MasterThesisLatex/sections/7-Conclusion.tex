\section{Future Work}

As mentioned in several papers, the pre-processing of the image itself might play a vital role in the ease of asbestos detection. For example thresholding and binarization reduces the noise in the image and transforms a gray scale image into a black and white image. This allows to clearly identify the asbestos like structures and could lead to architectures with less trainable parameters and better performance.
