\chapter{Design and Implementation}


\section{Problem Description}

Talk about the asbestos problem. The size of the images and the GPU restrictions on memory

\section{Data Augmentation}

What and why has the data been augmented

\section{AlexNext}

It has not been possible to get a baseline for the current performance or even an accurate estimation of human performance in the detection of asbestos fibers in provided images. Therefore AlexNet was used to create a baseline on which improvements may be observed would allow discussions on architectures and their performance. The hyper-parameters learning rate and learning rate decay have been optimized with gridsearch by running every configuration five times, averaging the results and choosing the hyper-parameters that performed best.

\section{Inception / ResNet}

Talk about other architectures and why they are important

\section{SigOpt Optimization}

What is SigOpt and why did I use it?
